Here's a list of my favorite albums of 2015, excluding D'Angelo since _Black Messiah_ came out in 2014 and should therefore count for 2014 (glares at half the major music publications).

### 10. Julia Holter: Have You In My Wilderness

Julia Holter's latest record, _Have You In My Wilderness_, is a marked improvement from her previous works. Her compositions are still gorgeous and intimate, and the instrumentation is still lush and atmospheric, but her songs feel more dynamic now; they inhabit a place that isn't as lived in as the worlds of _Loud City Song_ and _Ekstasis_, but rather that is constantly being shifted by Holter's presence. Part of this has to do with her wonderful voice, which is more at the forefront of this album than it has been in the past. As a result, we get standouts like single "Sea Calls Me Home", whose chorus of "I can't swim, it's lucitity! So clear!" will be stuck in your head for days.

### 9. Tobias Jesso Jr.: Goon

There's a moment toward the end of _Goon_ centerpiece "Hollywood", when Tobias Jesso Jr. starts to repeat "I think I'm gonna die in Hollywood" for the very last times and a wounded trumpet adds some sad flourishes after each line. Jesso's debut album _Goon_ is packed with amazing moments like this, as he puts masterful songwriting at the forefront of his songs and lets only a few instruments - a piano, percussion, some horns here and there - bring out the beauty of the music.

__Standout tracks__: How Could You Babe, Without You, Hollywood

### 8. SOPHIE: PRODUCT
<img src="http://static.spin.com/files/2015/09/sophie-product-new-album.jpg" height="350px" style="width: 350px !important" />

If this is what the future sounds like, then the future is bright, in more ways than one. This short and sweet collection of singles combines some of the best bubblegum pop and trap-influenced electronic music that PC Music has to offer. Inventive, intelligent, and full of some absolute bangers, _PRODUCT_ sheds preconceptions of what electronic music should sound like and strips it down to its poppy, melodic core. With the exception of "L.O.V.E.", which is interesting but literally painful to listen to, this is a near-perfect run of electronic pop songs.

__Standout tracks__: Bipp, Hard, Vyzee

### 7. Drake: If You're Reading This It's Too Late
<img src="http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/news/58558/46ceb4fa.jpg" height="350px" style="width: 350px !important" />

2015 was the year Drake became larger than life, and he didn't even release an official album. Instead, we got _If You're Reading This It's Too Late_, a pseudo-mixtape that infiltrated pop culture in a way only Drizzy can do. The beats aren't as extravagant as some of those on his proper LPs, but his rapping and ear for melody are stronger than ever. A good example of this is "Madonna", which has Drake employing a sort of lazy cadence and flow that makes an otherwise forgettable beat quite memorable. _If You're Reading This It's Too Late_ is self-mythologizing, because after the year he's had, he probably will die a legend.

__Standout tracks__: 10 Bands, Know Yourself, Jungle

### 6. Chvrches: Every Open Eye
<img src="http://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/36804-every-open-eye.jpg" height="350px" style="width: 350px !important" />

The magic of Chvrches is that they always manage to find the perfect mix of danceability and melancholy in their music. On their sophomore effort, they smartly refine what made them so compelling on _The Bones of What You Believe_: Lauren Mayberry's poignant lyrics, soaring vocal melodies, and synths that support rather than detract from the singing. Each song is engineered to perfection, with structures that are straightforward but effective. Also, who knew Martin Doherty could carry a song with his vocals, like he does on "High Enough to Carry You Over"?

__Standout tracks__: Leave a Trace, Clearest Blue, High Enough to Carry You Over

### 5. Kendrick Lamar: To Pimp a Butterfly
<img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/11/1426099817173/f1efb3f4-9a6d-4f78-8ca8-594ab646d198-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg" height="350px" style="width: 350px !important" />

_To Pimp a Butterfly_ is one of those albums that people started labeling as "art" immediately after it came out. It's dense, expansive and socially relevant. It features the single "Alright", which became the de facto anthem of the Black Lives Matter movement. It ends with a ten minute long interview with Tupac Shakur about black youths. It _feels_ important, an example of the power that music can have, and that's why it's so high on my list. That's not to say that the music isn't great as well, beause it is. Kendrick eschews the more accessible sound of his debut album _good kid, m.A.A.d city_ in favor of complex jazz fusion by the likes of Kamasi Washington and Thundercat, and while the result isn't as listenable as the story about his Compton upbringing, it's a more cohesive product about the universal struggles of the oppressed.

### 4. Grimes: Art Angels
<img src="http://cdn.albumoftheyear.org/album/43091-art-angels.jpg" height="350px" style="width: 350px !important" />

When Claire Boucher released the demo version of "REALiTi" in early 2015, it was difficult to tell where Grimes was going to go. We knew that she had already (supposedly) scrapped an album's worth of material because she didn't like it, but "REALiTi", which was salvaged from the cutting room floor, was already better than almost anything she had made before. With the release of her newest LP, Grimes made the wait worthwhile. Gone is the atmospheric dream pop of 2012's _Visions_; _Art Angels_ introduces a new brand of pop music that is distinctly Grimes'. With its floating, effervescent vocals and eclectic production, _Art Angels_ is catchy, fun and one of the most adventurous albums of the year.

### 3. Young Thug: Barter 6

Jeffrey Williams is a weird guy. He wears women's clothes, has a flamboyant style, and is involved in a strange love-hate relationship with Lil Wayne. Luckily, his music is just as interesting as him. Very few rappers in the game can effortlessly snake their way through a beat like Thugger, creating catchy flows seemingly on the spot. Listen to the way his voice escalates during the hook on "Can't Tell" or how he delivers the line "I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion" on "Knocked Off" and it's easy to tell that the man has a gift. His rapping is complemented perfectly by London on da Track and Wheezy's spacey production, and the result is Thugger's most cohesive and entertaining project to date.

__Standout tracks__: With That (feat. Duke), Check, Knocked Off (feat. Birdman)

### 2. Jamie xx: In Colour
<img src="http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/incolour_qrufwh.jpg" height="350px" style="width: 350px !important" />

A lot has been made about the originality of Jamie xx's brand of electronic music in the context of rave, but when it comes down to it, _In Colour_ is just an extremely enjoyable record to listen to. From the hypnotic dance rhythms of "Sleep Sound" to the bombastic Young Thug vocals on "I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)", the album is diverse yet accessible. There are some duds in here ("Obvs", "Stranger in a Room"), but the towering peaks more than make up for it. Even including his work with The xx, Jamie xx has certainly never reached such heights.

__Standout tracks__: Gosh, Loud Noises (feat. Romy), I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times) [feat. Young Thug & Popcaan]

### 1. Sufjan Stevens: Carrie & Lowell
<img src="http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/news/58935/dbfa1978.jpg" height="350px" style="width: 350px !important" />

_Carrie & Lowell_ was billed as Sufjan's return to his "folk roots," but it's so much more than that. It's a meditation on life, love and loss, a lens into a specific man's personal struggles that somehow resonates universally. Conceived and written after the death of his mother Carrie, who left him and his siblings when they were young, _Carrie & Lowell_ probably offered some much-needed catharsis for Sufjan but manages to avoid coming across as self-indulgent. Rather, the emotional quality of the lyrics ("We're all gonna die") and the beauty of the relatively sparse yet ethereal instrumentation make this his most moving, relatable and listenable album to date.

__Standout tracks__: Should Have Known Better, Fourth of July, The Only Thing
